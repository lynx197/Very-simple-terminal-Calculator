# Very-simple-terminal-Calculator
This is a Project where I set myself the goal of making a simple terminal calculator in python.
I decided to upload it on Github, because I thought it might be a great idea to introduce myself to Github 
and have the abillity to call for help, if needed.

Since my laptop is broken, I'm coding this from an iPad, so there might be some difficulties...

Licens will be added, as soon as i know which one to choose...
